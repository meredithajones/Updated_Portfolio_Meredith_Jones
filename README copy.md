Project Name: Meredith Jones Unit2-Responsive-Portfolio

Project Description: 

I created this proejct as an initial step to build my portfolio for my new career path as a developer. I began with the contact page pictured below:

Although this first step took me many hours, I was happy to see that a lot of the work that I did in formatting the header, footer and links could be duplicated in the other two pages of my portfolio. 

I got a lot of practice in using the Bootstrap grid system which I think will be of great use to me as time goes on. I appreciated the functionality that it provided for my portfolio images page in particular. I have included a screenshot of that page below for reference.

The page that I ended up struggling with the most was my "About Me" bio page. After many hours of trial and error, including consulting with my classmates as well as an Ask BCS Learning Assistant, I was unable to make to the card function or present the way that I know it should. I made numerous attempts at different approaches to make the text of my bio wrap around around my photo, but no amount of floating or orienting did the job. 

Unfortunately, given the time constraints that I am working with, I am subitting the project knowing that one of the pages is not as it should be. I welcome any feeback about how I can make it function and display as instructed.
